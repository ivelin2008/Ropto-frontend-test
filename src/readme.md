# Ropto frontend test finished

Test is finished. I used Gulp, SASS, HTML5, CSS3, javascript, jQuery and a few other extensions. I used the mobile first approach to make the website mobile optimized then I used media queries to make the desktop version. The form submits and also has some basic validation included.

You can install everything with:
npm install

and use the:
npm start

command, to start a server with the full app deployed.

Or alternatively, you can go to: 
http://ivelin2008.github.io

to see the website live.

I hope you like it.

Thank you,

Ivelin
